# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Importing math
### Step 2:
assigning 2 varaiable
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the calculated value
### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
d=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2)))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
